Any ways I just finished my website for my portfolio review and words cannot describe how nervous I am. <br> My pup has been keeping me company this weekend while I do homework and portfolio stuff. also i decided to redo my family room! <br> I will include a couple of photos of him and the new decor below! thats all for now (:  <p>
