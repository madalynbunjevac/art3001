I cannot grasp that this year is already coming to an end. Im happy but im sad about it. My therapist suggested that <br> I start journaling and it has to be with a paper and pen... Its been 3 days and now I look forward to it and <br> I think that its starting to help me plan out my days and live in the moment a little bit more. Now that the wheather is nicer I <br> have been doing alot of things outside including homework whenever I can. I went to the dog park with <br> charlie and mike (my boyfriend of 4 years who also goes to OSU) almost everyday because its been so nice out and its <br> almost theraputic to sit and play with all the dogs as stupid as that sounds. <br> Finals are coming up and im starting to get stressed out about them and all of my projects plus im on some new meds which <br> is medding me up so im trying to  manage through everything. Also Mike and I taught Charlie how to open doors at my apartment and boy do I regret that lol!! <br> There is absolutley no privacy at all haha! Anyways this was kind of a personal blog but I think it was much needed! <br> PS. I am taking this class again in the fall because I needed an extra class to fill my schedule for <br> art and tech and im so pumped bc this is probably one of my favorite classes.  <p>
