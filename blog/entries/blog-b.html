I have decided that writting about the last class may be annoying because everyone <br> who will be reading this has already had class. This weekend I made the decision to get 2 tattoos without telling my mother and <br> now I hope she cancles next weekend when shes supposed to visit. I dont think she is going to be very happy with me. Especially <br> because my friend gave them to me in my living room LOL but she is very good and just got a tattoo gun. Plus one of the tattoos <br> is meaning full and has to do with family. I got a sun that represents my grandma because she always sang "you are my sunshine" <br> to me when I was lilttle, then I got my moms favorite flower, a plant to rep me, and a butterfly for my sister because she <br> has been obsessed with them since she was little. Then I got another plant on my ankle. My mom and I have matching tattoos so hopefully <br> she wont be mad about this one YOLO. I will include photos and hopefully I can write about a good reaction in my next blog. </p>
