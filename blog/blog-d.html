<p style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Open Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;"> So my blog today is going to be about my week so far. I had to go home which is a 2 hour drive. I had to pack up clothes and all of my dogs stuff because <br> my brother was haivng an emergency surgery. It all happened so quick because he was her on saturday with my mom, grandma and sister and he was complaaining about a stomach ache <br> but we thought it was just from the food. Little did we know that he has appendicitis and his appendix was very close to breaking open and causing an infection.<br> The past 3 months have been absolutely crazy and hard to deal with when it comes to covid and family stuff. I also have my interview in the morning for the art and tech program. <br>I am  so nervous but I know that I worked really hard to get in and had to deal with alot of obstacles while doing so. I created a website of my work for this interview and I will link it at the bottom!  <br> <br> (click on the gif) <p>
