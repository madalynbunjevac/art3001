<p style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Open Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;"> This week has been very stressful because I have so many final projects due in a short amount of time... <br> Im getting better with working through my classes and trying to organize projects, essays and other assignments. <br> I still cant beleive that this year is almost over. My boyfriend and I are living in a house in cleveland <br> with charlie because we both have internships there. I am very excited to move in with mike but im sad to be leaving my cozy apartment in Columbus. <br> The house that Mike and I are staying in is his uncles house but his uncle moved <br> out so its perfect for the summer and we are going to occupy it during the summer before its sold. <br> Im glad to be going back home for the summer to be around family and friends. I think that its much needed after this year... <br> plus mikes parents and my family both have pools (:  <p>
