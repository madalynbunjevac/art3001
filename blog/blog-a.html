<p>First Blog!!! My blogs are going to be about what i've been up too and whats going on in my world. I thought that may be more exciting than talking about class again. <br> Every blog I would like to include a cool gif just to make it a little more interesting. so far i have redone and styled my website for about 7 hours now and I think im finally gettimg the hang of it! </p>
