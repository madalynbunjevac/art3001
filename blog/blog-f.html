<p style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Open Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;"> I dont really have alot to talk about in this blog- My week has been pretty boring and filled with homework and listening to true <br> crime podcasts. This weekend I took Charlie to campus and we walked and also went to the dog park where he loved rolling in <br> the mud lol. Now when I tell you he hates baths... He really hates baths. I literally have to sit in the bathtub with him and give <br> him a bath if im alone if no one can help me give him a bath. Thank god my boyfriend was here to help lol! So that was all I did this weekend! <p>
